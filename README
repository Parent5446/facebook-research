Facebook Research Application

This is a Python-based Facebook application made to test the ability of support vector machines
to predict the importance of a particular Facebook post to a given user.

The application takes a user's previous posts, comments, etc. as well as that of their friends,
trains a support vector machine with the retrieved data, and then predicts the importance of a new
set of posts.
